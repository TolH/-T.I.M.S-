For Arma 3 Epoch: https://epochmod.com/forum/
Required addons: @CUP_Terrains_Core, @CUP_Terrains_Maps, @CUP_Units, @CUP_Vehicles, @CUP_Weapons

# Info:

This is still a (W.I.P)

I very liked to play on arma3 Invade and Annex server, so i wanted to have that kind of town invasion but tuned down for my arma3 military epoch server.
So this is what i came up with... -T.I.M.S-

Goal: 

When a Town invasion start, AI's, 2 bunkers and one radio tower will spawn randomly around/in that town radius. 

First, you have to disable the communication tower to avoid more air reinforcement at the invaded town. Then you have to capture all three bunkers.

While capturing the bunkers, Waves of AI will try and defend the bunker to take it back. Timer and AI number per wave can be changed in config file.

Once the 2 bunkers are captured and most of the ai cleaned up, loot is then distributed around the bunkers/town marked on your map.

***This is still a work in progress and the goal is to get a militarized town invasion on hard difficulty with more idea to be added. When not building a base and bored, why not just go to war...
